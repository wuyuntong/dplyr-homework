```{r}

```

## Exercise 1

### Question 1

```{r}
n_song <- spotify |>
  distinct(title) |>
  nrow()
n_artist <- spotify |>
  distinct(artist) |>
  nrow()
n_genre <- spotify |>
  distinct(`top genre`) |>
  nrow()
```

The data set contains `r n_song` songs, `r n_artist` artists and `r n_genre` genres.

### Question 2

```{r}
spotify |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarise("number of songs" = n()) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

### Question 3

```{r}
artist_counts <- spotify |>
  distinct(title, .keep_all = TRUE) |>
  group_by(artist) |>
  summarise(num_songs = n()) |>
  slice_max(num_songs)
```

The most popular artist is `r artist_counts[1,1]`, who has `r artist_counts[1,2]` songs.

### Question 4

```{r}
spotify |>
  distinct(title, .keep_all = TRUE) |>
  group_by(`top genre`) |>
  summarise("min bpm" = min(bpm), "max bpm" = max(bpm), "mean bpm" = mean(bpm), "median tempo" = median(bpm), "number" = n()) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

### Question 5

```{r}
median_ed <- spotify |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarise(`median energy` = median(nrgy), `median dance` = median(dnce))
median_ed
```

### Question 6

```{r Evaluation of median energy and dancibility}
median_ed |>
  pivot_longer(-year, names_to = "variable", values_to = "value") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value, group = variable, color = variable)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2010:2019)
```

## Exercise 2

### Question 1

```{r}
m_age <- dropout |>
  group_by(Gender, `Marital status`) |>
  summarise(`Median age` = median(`Age at enrollment`), .groups = "drop_last")
m_age
```

### Question 2

```{r}
m_age |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = Gender, values_from = `Median age`) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

### Question 3

```{r}
mean_credit <- dropout |>
  group_by(Target) |>
  summarise(
    `Curricular units 1st sem (credited)` = mean(`Curricular units 1st sem (credited)`),
    `Curricular units 1st sem (enrolled)` = mean(`Curricular units 1st sem (enrolled)`),
    `Curricular units 1st sem (evaluations)` = mean(`Curricular units 1st sem (evaluations)`)
  )

mean_credit
```

### Question 4

```{r}
mean_credit |>
  pivot_longer(cols = c(`Curricular units 1st sem (credited)`, `Curricular units 1st sem (enrolled)`, `Curricular units 1st sem (evaluations)`), names_to = "Units", values_to = "Score") |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = Target, values_from = Score) |>
  knitr::kable()
```
